# Colorful Soulreaper

## Gameplay
The player controls a colored Sphere that moves forward automatically on an infinite
floor. The floor is divided into three lanes and throughout his/her journey, the player encounters
sphere collectibles and color changing zones. The goal of the game is to collect as many of the
matching color spheres scattered throughout the game while avoiding the non-matching color
spheres. When a player enters a color changing zone, the color of the player’s Sphere changes.
When a player collects a non matching color sphere, the player loses half of their score. The
game ends when the score reaches zero.
